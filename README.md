This repository documents the methodology I followed in selecting the MOSFETs and designing the bootstrap circuitry for driving the high side MOSFETs for an H-Bridge Inverter. 
The design was part of a competition for the course `Power Electronics Laboratory` (EE462L/EE394-7) and was judged based on optimizing for highest efficiency and lowest 
bill of materials (BOM). My design achieved the `2nd` highest efficiency in the history of the course.
